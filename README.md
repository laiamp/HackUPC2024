# RailShare (HackUPC2024 - TravelPerk Challenge)

RailShare is a go-to platform for planning train trips while prioritizing sustainability and social connections. Inspired by a interrail journey that we took some months ago, where we enjoyed meeting fellow travelers, RailsShare aims to recreate this experience for other passengers.

RailsShare takes your train trip details and generates routes from start to finish. But to get this objective, it uses smart algorithms that identifie other users traveling along similar routes. By matching travelers with shared interests, RailsShare helps form travel groups, making your journey not only eco-friendly but also socially rewarding.

And it's not just about getting from A to B. RailsShare suggests events and activities at various stops along your route, giving you the chance to explore new places and bond with your travel companions.

In order to find the routes, we used data from the European Interrail to build a graph.
